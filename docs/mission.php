A. INITIAL MISSION STATEMENT:
-----------------------------

This section will explain what I had originally in mind (starting 2 
months ago).  Some thoughts might be depricated by now, while other 
remain intact.  But hopefully, a lot of new idea's and concepts can
and will be introduced soon.  Anyway, this is more or less what the
orginal plan looked like:

First we start making a slashdot.org alike site: a community weblog
that offers all you need to know: 'News for nerds.  Stuff that matters.'
If you have an account on ./ you'll notice it is highly configurable:
every single tidbit can be configured and tuned.  Once we have such
system we could go online so we can start building a user base.

When people submit news, it goes in a queue.  In case of Slashdot, 
Slashdot's editors can edit, post or delete your story from the queue.
Like that they filter all the news they recieve and decide what is 
being posted.

What I had in mind was is very semilar yet quite different!  In first
place, editors should *not* necessary be in control - the site should
rely on his readers.  Therefore, logged-in users can see the queue of
pending stories as well, and can vote on whether they want to see the
news displayed or not.  If the news entry reaches a certain positive
value, the story goes up.  If it reaches a certain negative value, it
dissapears in the void.  The threshold can be expressed in terms of 
the number of registered users.  Say we have 1.000 users and that our
threshold is set to 5%, then a story would be posted if it reaches a
score of 50 and will be dropped if it reaches -50.  The underlying 
idea is simple: the more users you have, the more votes a story needs,
the better the quality of your stories.  Of course, droppies (like us)
can always force a story to be posted or can drop stories no matter
what.

[Note: unfortunatly, there is another new site that recently did the 
very same.  Check <A HREF="http://www.kuro5hin.org/">http://www.kuro5hin.org/</A> to grab the concept.  I had 
the same ideas even before I heared about kuro5hin.org.  It does not 
matter - we are going to be better anyway: you know it, I know it! ;)]

No complaints about the quality of our stories as it is the community 
that 'sorts the wheat from the chaff', not the site editors.  It's no
longer up to us, the editors, to judge and write stories.  We are not
'real' editors, instead we are the technicians behind the engine: we 
make them a tool to filter out the spam, flamebait and trolls.  We
keep an eye on things, we adjust and fine-tune the engine, but it are
our visitors that brings along the content and the quality of the site!
Typically, adding content to a site is the most difficult part so why
not leave it up to the visitors?  After all, we are webdesigners, 
programmers and artists, not writers nor editors.  Personally, I don't
want to edit or to write news - I want to do what I like to do: 
programming and webdesign.  It magically fits the concept.

If we are busy with other things or if we are absent, the page should
be pretty much able to 'live' on its very own.  If people prefer news
about 'Sience', then they'll delever it and vote for it.  If they 
prefer to read about 'Cooking' then cooking news and reciepts will be 
posted.  If people are bored by the recent oepla about DeCSS or Napster,
they will simply vote it down.

It think the above explanation pretty much covers the *initial* idea.
There are many, many features and concepts that can be added.  Other 
such concepts and/or interesting sites for inspiration include:

 * Personally, I would love to integrate a diary system - to provide 
   each registered user with a public diary (sort of .plan files).
   Each visitors could keep an online, public diary while other people
   - for instance - could add those people to there 'diaries-to-track'
   list.
     - <A HREF="http://www.advogato.com/">http://www.advogato.com/</A>

 * To import and filter headlines from other sites in an intelligent
   way.  Basically by fetching and compiling the RDF files of news
   portals to something cheezy.  A lot of sites offer news for FREE,
   but very few sites do something really useful with it.
   It's just a matter of collecting it, processing it, combining it,
   and displaying it in a better way. (The good news is that there
   are standarized ways to grab news from other sites.)
     - <A HREF="http://my.userland.com/">http://my.userland.com/</A>
       They grab headlines from various sites and try to categorize
       them in the most intelligent way.
     - <A HREF="http://www.tomandian.com/weblog/">http://www.tomandian.com/weblog/</A>
       They grab headlines from various sites and try to make an
       'intersection' of a who is linking to what today.

  * Meta moderation (already partial integrated).
      - <A HREF="http://www.slashdot.org/moderation.shtml">slashot's moderation guidelines</A> (must read)

  * ... [your ideas?]

As you can see, there is plenty of space for input and innovation. It
is all about how we can automatically generate content and how can we 
bring (read: display) it in the best way: user-friendly and strucuterd.
What we have here is a complex and advanced concept, but it should not 
leave a single visitor with a 'bloated' feeling.  Even: how can we 
eventually bring it to cell phones, PDAs, etc because that is where the
internet is taking us.  (Obviously, different devices require different
ways of visualisation.)

As well, what kind of interactivity (comments, webboards, polls) are 
most people looking for.  To deliver news is one thing, but to provide 
flexible ways for discussion is another thing.  People want to express
their thoughts and opinions and share their insights and expertise.  
Some humans out there try to be social, you know.  Other people are a 
social problem though, and will post spam and flamebait.  We need to 
make sure that those post can be filtered out: not by us, but by the 
rest of the drop community.  (= 'comment moderation', see later)

Remind that this was the initial concept!  We certainly don't need to
stick to the initial plan.
