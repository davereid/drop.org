   5. What is comment moderation and how does it work?
        After a weblog gains some popularity, an inevitable question
        shows up: "how do we sort the wheat from the chaff?".
        The purpose of comment moderation is two-fold:
          * To bring the really good comments to everyone's attention.
          * To hide or get get rid of spam, flamebait and trolls.
        In the latter, comment moderation provides a technical solution
        to a social problem.

        Under construction.
